# AI-powered Social Media Content Moderation System

## Summary

This project aims to create an AI system that automatically detects and filters inappropriate content on social media platforms. The system will identify offensive language, hate speech, harassment, and other forms of harmful content, ensuring a safer and more welcoming environment for users.

## Background

**Problem:**  
Social media platforms struggle with moderating harmful content like hate speech, bullying, and explicit material. While human moderators are effective, the sheer volume of content uploaded daily makes it nearly impossible to catch everything.

**Personal Motivation:**  
I'm motivated by the potential to create safer digital spaces for individuals and communities.

**Importance:**  
With increasing online interactions, thereâ€™s a growing need for intelligent moderation systems to protect users from harmful content.

## How is it used?

**Context:**  
This system can be integrated into any social media platform that allows user-generated content.

**Who Are the Users?**  
- Social media platforms
- Content moderators

**User Needs:**  
- Real-time detection of harmful content
- Context-aware moderation tools

## Data Sources and AI Methods

**Data Sources:**  
- Text data from social media platforms: Posts, comments, and messages.
- Labeled datasets of harmful content: Datasets from Kaggle or open sources.

**AI Techniques:**  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Deep Learning (RNN, Transformers like BERT)

## Challenges

**Limitations:**  
- False positives and negatives.
- Bias in the training data.
- Contextual understanding of subtle language.

**Ethical Considerations:**  
- Privacy and freedom of speech.

## What next?

- **Multi-language support**
- **Real-time implementation**
- **Improvement through continuous learning**

## Acknowledgments

- Kaggle for datasets.
- Hugging Face for NLP tools.
